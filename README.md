# Create-BlockchainNetwork-IBPV20
Creating a basic Blockchain network using the IBM Blockchain Platform V2.0




Welcome to the first in a series of building a Blockchain application using the IBM Blockchain Platform V2.0. **Part 1** will show you how to set up your Blockchain network on the IBM Cloud. This will be the "Hello World" of Hyperledger samples using the IBM Blockchain Platform V2.0. - so beginner developers should be able to manage this. This pattern shows you how to test your network by packaging your smart contract using the IBM Blockchain Platform extension on VS Code and then deploy it onto the network.  The network uses Hyperledger Fabric V1.4.

Hyperledger Fabric is a blockchain framework implementation and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by The Linux Foundation. Intended as a foundation for developing applications or solutions with a modular architecture, Hyperledger Fabric allows components, such as consensus and membership services, to be plug-and-playIn

[Part 2](https://github.com/IBM/SmartContractTrading-wFabric1-4-VSCodeExt), we will explore more about creating a complex network with multiple participants and using Access Control Rules (ACL) to provide them network access permissions. In this journey, you will run Hyperledger Fabric on the Cloud.

When you have completed this code pattern, you will understand how to:

* Package the smart contract using IBM Blockchain Platform Extension for VS Code
* Setup a Hyperledger Fabric network on IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0
* Install and instantiate smart contract package onto the IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0
* Interact with the contract and execute transactions using the SDK.


# Architecture flow

<p align="center">

</p>

1. The developer develops a smart contract using Node.js
2. Use the IBM Blockchain Platform Extension for VS Code to package the smart contract.
3. Setup and launch the IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0 service
4. The IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0 enables the creation of a network onto a IBM Kubernetes Service, enabling installation and instantiation of the smart contract on the network
5. The Node.js application uses the Fabic SDK to interact with the deployed network on IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0 and issues transactions.



# Included components

# Running the application

Follow these steps to set up and run this code pattern. The steps are described in detail below.

### Steps

1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Package the smart contract](#2-package-the-smart-contract)
3. [Create IBM Cloud services](#3-create-ibm-cloud-services)
4. [Build a network](#4-build-a-network)
5. [Deploy Blockchain-network Smart Contract on the network](#5-deploy-blockchain-network-smart-contract-on-the-network)
6. [Connect application to the network](#6-connect-application-to-the-network)
7. [Run the application](#7-run-the-application)


## 1. Clone the repo

Clone this repository in a folder your choice:

```
git clone https://github.com/IBM/Create-BlockchainNetwork-IBPV20
```


## 2. Package the smart contract

We will use the IBM Blockchain Platform extension on VS Code to package the smart contract.

If you have not done so already, you will need to install the IBM Blockchain Platform VSCode extension — you’ll also need to install the latest version of VSCode to do this. To see if you have the latest version go to Help ->  Check for updates. If VSCode exits at this point, it likely means you don’t have the latest version. If so, update your VSCode (using the link provided earlier) and once you’re done, click on  extensions in the sidebar on the left side of your screen. At the top, search the extensions marketplace for IBM Blockchain Platform and click on Install. You should see a status of “Installing” and eventually “Installed” — then click on reload.

* Open Visual Studio code and open the `contract` folder from `Create-BlockchainNetwork` repository that was cloned earlier.  
   **It is important that you are opening the `contract` folder and not the entire `Create-BlockchainNetwork` directory; otherwise you will see an error that states that it doesn't understand what programming language you are using.**

* Press the `F1` key to see the different VS code options. Choose `IBM Blockchain Platform: Package a Smart Contract Project`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-images/vs-code-options.png">
</p>


* Click the `IBM Blockchain Platform` extension button on the left. This will show the packaged contracts on top and the blockchain connections on the bottom.

<p align="center">
  <img height="500" src="docs/doc-images/ibm-blockchain-extension.png">
</p>

* Next, right click on the packaged contract (in this case, select blockchain-network@0.0.1) to export it and choose `Export Package`.

* Choose a location on your machine and save `.cds` file.  We will use this packages smart contract later to deploy on the IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0 service.


Now, we will start setting up and configuring our Hyperledger Fabric network on the IBM Cloud.

## 3. Create IBM Cloud services

* Create the [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/infrastructure/containers-kubernetes).  You can find the service in the `Catalog`.  For this code pattern, we can use the `Free` cluster, and give it a name.  Note, that the IBM Cloud allows one instance of a free cluster and expires after 30 days. **Note: it could take 20 minutes for the Kubernetes Service setup to complete**.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/create-ibm-kubernetes-service.gif">
</p>
<br>

* Create the [IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/blockchain/) service on the IBM Cloud.  You can find the service in the `Catalog`, and give a name.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/create-ibm-blockchain-2-service.gif">
</p>
<br>

* After your kubernetes cluster is up and running, you can deploy your IBM Blockchain Platform on the cluster. Again - wait for the Kubernetes service to indicate it was deployed.  The IBM Blockchain Platform service walks through few steps and finds your cluster on the IBM Cloud to deploy the service on.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/deploy-blockchain-on-cluster.gif">
</p>
<br>

* Once the Blockchain Platform is deployed on the Kubernetes cluster, you can launch the console to start configuring your blockchain network.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/register-app-admin.gif">
</p>
<br>


* #### Update application connection
  - Copy the connection profile you downloaded into [application folder](application)
  - Update the [config.json](application/config.json) file with:
    - The connection json file name you downloaded.
    - The <b>enroll id</b> and <b>enroll secret</b> for your app admin, which we earlier provided as `app-admin` and `app-adminpw`.
    - The orgMSP ID, which we provided as `org1msp`.
    - The caName, which can be found in your connection json file under "organization" -> "org1msp" -> certificateAuthorities". This would be like an IP address and a port.
    - The username you would like to register.
    - Update gateway discovery to `{ enabled: true, asLocalhost: false }` to connect to IBP.



```bash
 {
    "connection_file": "mychannel_blockchain-network_profile.json",
    "channel_name": "mychannel",
    "smart_contract_name": "blockchain-network",
    "appAdmin": "app-admin",
    "appAdminSecret": "app-adminpw",
    "orgMSPID": "org1msp",
    "caName": "169.46.208.151:30404",
    "userName": "user1",
    "gatewayDiscovery": { "enabled": true, "asLocalhost": false }
 }
```



## 7. Run the application

* #### Enroll admin
  - First, navigate to the `application` directory, and install the node dependencies.
    ```bash
    cd application
    npm install
    ```

  - Run the `enrollAdmin.js` script
    ```bash
    node enrollAdmin.js
    ```

  - You should see the following in the terminal:
    ```bash
    msg: Successfully enrolled admin user app-admin and imported it into the wallet
    ```


  - Run the `invoke-transactions.js` script to execute the transactions on the smart contract
    ```bash
    node invoke-transactions.js
    ```

  - You should see the following in the terminal:
    ```bash
    Wallet path: /Users/laurabennett/2019/patterns/Create-BlockchainNetwork-IBPV20/application/wallet
    2019-03-05T05:17:59.823Z - error: [Client.js]: Channel not found for name mychannel

    "{\"tradingSymbol\":\"commodityA\",\"description\":\"farm-commodity\",\"traderId\":\"traderA\"}" 
    addCommodityResponse_JSON.parse: {"tradingSymbol":"commodityA","description":"farm-commodity","traderId":"traderA"}

    Submit Commodity trade transaction.
    2019-03-05T05:18:05.964Z - info: [TransactionEventHandler]: _strategySuccess: strategy success for transaction "9146776c552bb4374920a2e511d8b4d2fb243e3938560f4aa87ceb8480a84a8e"
    
    commodityTradeResponse: 
    "{\"description\":\"farm-commodity\",\"traderId\":\"traderB\",\"tradingSymbol\":\"commodityA\"}"
    commodityTradeResponse_JSON.parse: {"description":"farm-commodity","traderId":"traderB","tradingSymbol":"commodityA"}

    ```


## Troubleshooting

* If you receive the following error on submitting transaction:
`error: [Client.js]: Channel not found for name mychannel`

  It is safe to ignore this error because the ibp2.0 beta has service discovery enabled. (In order to use service discovery to find other peers please define anchor peers for your channel in the ui). If you really want the message to go away you can add the channels section to the connection profile, but it is a warning rather than a true error telling the user the channel is found but not in the connection profile 

  As an example you can manually add the following json and updated the IP address and ports manually:
  
  ```
  "channels": {
          "mychannel": {
              "orderers": [
                  "169.46.208.151:32078"
              ],
              "peers": {
                  "169.46.208.151:31017": {}
              }
          }
      },
  ```

## Extending the code pattern
This application can be expanded in a couple of ways:
* Create a wallet for every member and use the member's wallet to interact with the application.
* Add a UI application in place of the `invoke.js` node application to execute the transactions.
